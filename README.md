Optimizing Vehicle Choices: A Data-Driven Approach to Fuel Consumption and CO₂ Emissions in Canada 🚗🌿
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-powered dashboard designed to help consumers, policymakers, and manufacturers make informed decisions on vehicle fuel efficiency, emissions, and carbon tax impact. Our goal is to enhance the existing EnerGuide system by integrating predictive analytics and data visualization to provide actionable insights.
